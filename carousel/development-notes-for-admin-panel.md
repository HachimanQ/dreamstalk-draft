most important part of the admin panel is its functionality to add, delete or edit content on the website. It might show some data
in later versions but that is not a priority for now. Ideal admin panel has a very simple design. I think a panel like facebooks 'create post' section with a few more functionalities will suffice. extra functionalities may include things such as: visibility, publish time (now or few days later etc.). I'm sure there are many more things to add but lets code the foundation first.

(work with basic add elements from javascript. in later version, they will be turned into react and auto generate)
