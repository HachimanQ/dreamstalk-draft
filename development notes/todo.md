HUGE PROBLEM: In comiteePage, eventPage: ROW-FEATURETTE PART IS NOT RESPONSIVE

IN CONTACTS PAGE, THE PHONE AND EMAIL SECTION GETS MESSED UP IN MOBILE SCREENS. USE MORE RESPONSIVE DESIGN TO FIX

little problem: organization got too messed up. links to css files are all over the code, links to js files too.
standardize them. fix the file organization too.

improve accessability by replacing some div's with sections.

carousels' css are a bit messed up with distinct rules. 




MINI TO-DOs:





6- remove carousels sliding parts if they are unnecessary



(LATE VERSION!!
 1- AFTER COMPLETING THE CONVERSION TO REACT, CREATE A ADMIN PANEL WHICH THE ADMIN CAN USE TO ADD CONTENT TO THE PAGE)
 2- MAKE NAVLINKS TO BE MORE REACTIVE, THEY SHOULD EXPAND WHEN HOVERED OVER
 * fill the footer with buttons and directions as well.
5- learn the ideal background image pixels for the carousel.
6- complete sponsorts page: it will be similar to https://businessclub.metu.edu.tr/sponsorlar (THIS PART REQUIRES GRID, SO IT WILL BE COMPLETED IN THE SECOND VERSION) 
(USE THIS TO COMPLETE https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/grid/)
2- complete contact page contact page will be similar to https://www.maketistan.com/iletisim (with better background image of course)
